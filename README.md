# async-runtimes-benchmarks

Contains (rust) code from
https://github.com/hez2010/async-runtimes-benchmarks-2024 üëè

This repository contains a few programs written in various programming
languages. Each program spawns N concurrent tasks. The number of tasks is
controlled by the command line argument. Each tasks waits 10 seconds and
finishes. The programs finish when all tasks exit.

The purpose of those programs is to measure the memory footprint of concurrent
tasks in different language runtimes.
